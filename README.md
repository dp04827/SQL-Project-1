# SQL-Project-1
# **Problem Description**

  The task at hand is to model and build a relational database for the general operations of a fitness and health app that collects and analyzes daily health and fitness data from its users. The central entity in the model is the Person entity, who is the user of the app. The goal is for each individual who registers on the app to track their exercise, nutrition, sleep, and overall health.
The app provides various features, including workout plans, diet tracking, activity monitoring, and personalized coaching, all of which are linked to user engagement and fitness progress. We aim to accurately model the relationships between users, their fitness activities, nutritional habits, health metrics,  and subscription plans. Additionally, we will generate sample data to populate into our entities and their attributes. Finally, we will perform functional queries on this dataset to extract valuable insights regarding user behavior, workout effectiveness, engagement trends, and overall app performance.
